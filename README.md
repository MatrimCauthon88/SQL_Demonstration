# SQL_Demonstration

## Introduction

This project shows basic SQL skills as well as how SQL can be used with Python coding language to create visuals to answer questions. This demonstration uses credit card transactions to show how a database, tables within the database, and views can be created. It will also show how csv files can be imported, queries can be done, both with joins and without joins,  as well as how Python can be used with SQL to create some visuals to answer some questions. For this demonstration we are using PostgreSQL, which utilizes pgAdmin to run. 


## Database Creation

We used https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/ to create our Entity Relationship Diagram or ERD. There are three models that one can use when creating an ERD. The first and most basic ERD model is caled a conceptual model. This model really only contains the table names in a database. It can also be created to show relationships between the tables if you wanted to.
