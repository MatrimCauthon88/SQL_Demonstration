This project shows basic SQL skills as well as how SQL can be used with Python coding language to create visuals to answer questions. This demonstration uses credit card transactions to show how a database, tables within the database, and views can be created. It will also show how csv files can be imported, queries can be done, both with joins and without joins,  as well as how Python can be used with SQL to create some visuals to answer some questions. For this demonstration we are using PostgreSQL, which utilizes pgAdmin to run.
